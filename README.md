Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Fun Fact Generator is a lightweight web application designed to provide users with random, interesting facts fetched from a public API. The app is educational, fun, and highly interactive, encouraging users to learn something new with every click.

1.2 Scope
This application allows users to generate random fun facts through an intuitive and responsive user interface. Users can continuously fetch facts by clicking a button, and the app dynamically updates with a new fact. It's a beginner-friendly project built using Python and PyWebIO, demonstrating how web apps can be made interactive without requiring extensive frontend knowledge.

1.3 Goals and Objectives

Fetch random fun facts from a public API.
Provide a clean and responsive user interface.
Ensure seamless interactivity with dynamic content updates.
1.4 Benefits

Provides entertainment and educational value.
Showcases how simple tools like PyWebIO can be used to create web apps.
Acts as a foundational project for beginners learning Python web development.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Fact Fetching

The app must fetch fun facts from the Useless Facts API: https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/random.json?language=en.
2.2 User Interface

The header must have a black background with white text.
The displayed fun fact should appear in a styled, centered box.
Buttons should have gradient styling and an interactive click behavior.
2.3 User Interaction

Clicking the button fetches and displays a new fun fact dynamically without refreshing the page.
2.4 Dynamic Updates

The page should update dynamically to clear the previous fact and display the new one seamlessly.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance

The app should fetch fun facts within 1 second of clicking the button.
The API response must be handled gracefully, even during network delays or API failures.
3.2 Usability

The app must have an intuitive interface, suitable for all ages.
Buttons and text must be appropriately sized for readability.
3.3 Scalability

The app must support multiple users simultaneously without any performance degradation.
3.4 Compatibility

The app must work across different browsers and devices.
3.5 Reliability

The app must handle API errors gracefully and notify users if the API is unreachable.
4. System Design
4.1 Architecture

The application is built using a client-server model.
Frontend: PyWebIO for UI components.
Backend: Python handles API requests and dynamically updates the interface.
4.2 Data Flow

User clicks the "Click me" button.
The app sends an HTTP GET request to the Useless Facts API.
The API returns a JSON response containing the fact.
The app extracts the fact and updates the display dynamically.
5. UI Design
5.1 Layout

A black-themed header with white text.
A centered fun fact displayed in a styled box with rounded corners and a shadow.
A button below the fact to fetch a new one.
5.2 Color Scheme

Background: Black.
Text: White and Blue.
Buttons: Gradient colors for an engaging look.
6. Testing
6.1 Functional Testing

Verify that the button fetches and displays a new fact.
Ensure the API call returns the correct fact from the Useless Facts API.
6.2 UI Testing

Check that the app displays all elements correctly across devices and browsers.
Verify the fact box and buttons are responsive.
6.3 Error Handling

Simulate API unavailability and ensure the app displays an appropriate error message.
7. Future Enhancements
Add multilingual support for facts.
Provide a feature to share the fact on social media.
Allow users to save their favorite facts locally.
Enhance the UI with animations for a better user experience.
